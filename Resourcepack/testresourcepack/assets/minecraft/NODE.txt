Hello, it's me, SirWolf.
Just here to tell you about the do_it.sh

The do_it.sh is a tool written by me in bash. It generates you the files you need for custom model data textures.
I fist wanted to delete it, but meh, i'm just going to keep it here anyways. Maybe it's usefull for some of you.

But be aware, it will only work on linux, or with some tools on linux like msys2, etc.

You can use it with:

./do_it.sh <name_of_the_item> <from> <to> <generate_json>

THis will generate the custom model data files for "name_of_the_item" from the model data "from" to "to". 
And if you set the last flag, "generate_json" to 1, it will generate an extra json in the /models/item folder which stores the overrides for the textures.

This was done in like 5 minutes and is not that good. Still, i'm going to keep it here.

Have fun ^^
